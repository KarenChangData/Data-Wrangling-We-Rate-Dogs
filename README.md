The project of Data wrangling includes the following steps:

1. Gathering data: data source is from twitter.
2. Assessing data: we assess data based on Quality and Tidiness.
3. Cleaning data: based on the identified issues at step 2, we clean data, e.g., change data type, change data structure and etc. 
4. Storing data: After the data is cleaned, we store it into a new database.
5. Analyzing data
6. Visulizing data

Two reports are created to document the above process:
1. act_report: This report summarized the limitation of data wrangling and the conclusion of data analysis.
2. wrangle _report: This report documented the quality and tidiness issues noted during data assessment.
